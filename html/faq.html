<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br>
<br>

										<h2>Am I responsible for booking my own flights?</h2>
<p>Here at Camp Thailand 2019, we offer an incredible
    opportunity for travel enthusiasts to experience life
    in the jewel of Asia; apply for the opportunity to secure
    a Summer of scintillating sunshine, phenomenal friendships
    and an abundance of unforgettable memories you’ll be
    guaranteed to cherish forever.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>What sort of accommodation will I be staying in at Camp Thailand?</h2>
<p>You will stay in a bright and airy, bunk bedded room typically with 3-5 other
	people (of the same gender as yourself) sharing the room. We also have a
	couple of dorm style rooms which house up to 12 people.
<br>
<br>
Most of the rooms are fan cooled and in some locations they will have Air
con. During most months of the year Thailand has a tropical climate and the
Summer months are much hotter and more humid than the winter months.
<br>
<br>
Most Camp Thailand participants think that it is more fun to stay in the bunk
bedded rooms with their new friends – but if you are travelling with a partner
 and wish to have more privacy you may wish to consider your own private room
  for the duration of your stay. To discuss this further, please contact the office.
<br>
Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Is Wi-Fi available at Camp Thailand?</h2>
<p>Yes, Wi-Fi is available, whether it be in a communal area or in your
	room. However, we try our best to ensure that Wi-Fi is available in most
	areas of your accommodation.
<br>
Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure
 orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Do we have access to cooking facilities or a kitchen at Camp?</h2>
<p>In Thailand most people live in dwellings without kitchens as cheap,
	fresh and delicious food is available everywhere. Popular Western food
	choices are also available here. At all our Camps we have 7/11 shops
	that are open 24 hours, plus other convenience stores within a five
	minute walk of the accommodation. There are also a large number of
	eating establishments in the immediate vicinity of your Camp Thailand location.
<br>
Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure
orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.

      										<h2>Are meals at Camp Thailand included in the program fee?</h2>
      <p>The meals that are included are the delicious lunches that are provided
				by the Thai schools on the days you are teaching there. Please
				note that in some cases we will be in the schools for under
				two hours and in the cases of temple schools and orphanages they
				don’t have the budget to provide lunch. Don’t worry though, there
				is an abundance of inexpensive, fresh and delicious food from the
				many food stands and small family restaurants.
				<br>
				<br>
You can buy cheap, delicious and healthy Thai food for breakfast from
many of the local street vendors in the surrounding area.
<br>
Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure
orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Are there washing machines on hand at our accommodation?</h2>
<p>For about 1.20 GBP per kilo (approx. 2.25 lbs) local laundry services
	will wash your clothes early morning and return them washed and neatly
	pressed the following afternoon.
	<br>
	<br>
Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure
orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</a></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Do I get any free time at Camp?</h2>
<p>You will get at least one day off a week (usually at the weekends).
	However, we run activities on your days off. You’re usually only
	in the schools for around 4-6 hours a day, leaving the rest of the
	afternoon to explore and partake in weekly activities or explore the local area.
